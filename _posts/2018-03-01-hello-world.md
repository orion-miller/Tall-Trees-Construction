title: "our vision"
description: "We are innovating nanopore technology for rapid, high throughput, multiplex detection of biomarkers for disease diagnosis and virus screening. Biomarkers in an electrically conductive solution produce an electrical signal as it passes through a nanometer hole (nanopore). This electrical signal produced by the biomarker is unique and this electrical “signature” can be analyzed to identify the biomarker and quantify its concentration. We employed this property of nanopores in our technology for RNA detection and we demonstrated this principal by measuring ultra-low quantities of COVID mRNA without using PCR amplification. Our nanopore technology is capable of fast (5-15mins) mRNA quantification due to directly measuring the electrical signatures of the biomarker. Importantly, our method is flexible and can be adapted to detect various biomarkers including DNA, protein, and metabolites. Our goal is to develop this technology to produce a convenient product capable of rapid multiple biomarker detection. Electro Ohmics’s mission is to use electricity to detect multiomic biomarkers (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics) to improve health care outcomes."
