# Research Topics

## Scientific visualization
 Project Raijin was awarded by NSF EarthCube in order to develop
community-owned, sustainable, scalable tools for data analysis and visualization that can
operate on unstructured (i.e. not regular lat/lon grids) climate and global weather data at global
storm resolving resolutions. The development of Project Raijin leverages the Scientific Python
Ecosystem (SPE), particularly the open development Xarray and Dask packages, and the
Pangeo community. Our work is conducted under an open development model that encourages
participation of the community in all aspects of the projectâ€™s development. As a result of this, the
brand new Python package, UXarray, has been created.
