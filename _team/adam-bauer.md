## Bio
Adam is a graduate student in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois. He joined CDDS@UIUC in 2021, where he began working on two projects: one related to the physics of heat waves/extreme events, and another related to climate economics. Broadly speaking, he is interested in theoretical approaches to climate change related problems, and specializes in dynamical systems. He organizes the Climate Discussion Group with Tyler Hanke and Rachel Tam, and is a part of the graduate-undergraduate peer mentoring program in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at UIUC. He earned an NSF GRFP in 2022.

Adam did his undergraduate studies at the University of Arizona where he double majored in physics and mathematics, and minored in astronomy. At UArizona, he primarily focused on problems in astrophysics. He worked on numerous projects related to understanding massive galaxy clusters, the fluid mechanics of the solar wind, and the inner horizon(s) of black holes. He won the Excellence in Undergraduate Research Award from the UArizona College of Science for his contributions to each of these fields.

Adam grew up in Buffalo, New York, an upbringing that prepared him well for the cold midwestern winters. In his spare time, Adam rock climbs. A lot. He also plays and studies chess. He enjoys reading, especially books on history, economics, and philosophy, as well as really, really corny self-help books. He listens to way too many podcasts and music across a variety of genres. He also loves sports and lives and dies by the Buffalo Bills.
