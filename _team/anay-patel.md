## Bio
Anay is an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois, double majoring in Atmospheric Sciences and Statistics. He joined CDDS@UIUC in Summer 2022, where he began working on a paleoclimate project. Generally, he is interested in leveraging statistics in order to analyze climate related problems, especially with the growing prevalence of climate change. 

Anay has worked on a few other research projects throughout his undergraduate career. In Fall 2020, he participated in a research opportunity within the Atmospheric Sciences department related to tornado intensity precursors. Then in Spring 2021, he was selected for the Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program where he worked with a graduate student mentor on a project studying phosphorus pollution in Lake Erie. 

Anay grew up in Schaumburg, Illinois, a moderately sized Chicago suburb, so he is fairly acquainted with the Midwest. In his spare time, Anay enjoys taking walks, listening to music, playing video games, and spending time with friends. He also enjoys playing ping pong, hiking, and traveling. He occasionally watches documentaries and browses the internet in search of some interesting news.
