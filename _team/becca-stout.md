## Bio
Becca started as a graduate student with Gerard Roe in 2020 in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington. Her research focuses on paleoclimate dynamics, and she is currently working with Cristi on a project related to Holocene climate variability. She completed her undergraduate degree in Earth & Planetary Sciences at Harvard University, where she conducted research related to Last Interglacial sea level. Her undergraduate thesis won a Hoopes Prize. She was a 2021-2022 Schlanger Fellow.

Becca is originally from McMinnville, Oregon. After college, her love of tall mountains brought her back to the west coast for her PhD. Outside of work, Becca spends her time rock climbing, backpacking, and reading. She also likes knitting and doing improv, although her outsized enthusiasm for these two activities does not necessarily match her level of skill.
