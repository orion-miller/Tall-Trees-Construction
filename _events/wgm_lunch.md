Maddie hosts a weekly women's and gender minorities' lunch for faculty and students in the Atmospheric Sciences department. Folks from other departments who work on climate/weather/sustainability related fields are encouraged to join as well. If you identify as a woman or gender minority (transgender, non-binary, etc.) we'd love to have you! Send Maddie an email at mstover2 [at] illinois [dot] edu and I will keep you in the loop.
