# Logistics
## Format
The basic format of our meetings is pretty simple: we select a paper to read as a group, and then meet to discuss in an open forum. We also occasionally have invited speakers/UIUC students who come and give talks about their work.

CDG is very informal, and students of all levels are welcome! 

**Please email a student-in-charge to get added to the listserv and get any more details.**
